BUILDING A MODEL TO PREDICT HOUSING PRICES

In this module’s project, you will use knowledge from the past modules to complete a linear regression analysis on the 
`houseSmallData` dataset. This dataset contains columns that describe housing features, such as the lot size in square feet, 
the type of road access, and the flatness of the property. You will use this dataset to predict the price of each house based on 
the values of the other variables in your dataset.

Goals and expectations:

First, you will download the houseSmallData.csv file and open the Project Outline Template using your local instance of Jupyter 
Notebook.

You will be asked to complete each section of the Project Outline Template. You will begin by writing an abstract about the project 
along with a description of the data that you will be working with.

Next, you will import your data and perform an exploratory analysis to familiarize yourself with the data. This section of the 
project will culminate with a correlation analysis of the columns in the dataframe. Your goal is to derive insight about which 
variables may be more or less useful for your prediction.

In the next section of the project, you will implement the linear regression algorithm using the Python Scikit-learn library and 
analyze the results of the algorithm.

Finally, you will draw conclusions about your project’s results and findings.

In addition to the Project Outline Template Jupyter Notebook, you will be asked to submit a PowerPoint slide deck with a summary of 
your findings. A Slide Deck Template is provided. The slide deck should contain a concise description of all the steps that you 
performed in the Jupyter Notebook. It should not include any code, just numerical values about your results and images of your plots.
